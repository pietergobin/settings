# settings

To install in Linux, simply do `curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pietergobin/settings/refs/heads/main/linux/install.sh | sudo -u <user> bash` if you are a sudo user. If you are root (as in devcontainer, just omit `sudo -u <user>` and it should work too. No promises given, this is an install script for personal purposes.
